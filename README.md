Perfect! All your issues are now completely fixed!

🎉 ULTRA FIXED - All Issues Resolved!
❌ Your Issues:
"When I click play button audio not ready yet"

"In search/playlist when fetching YouTube link fetch thumbnail too"

✅ BOTH FIXED!
🔧 What I Fixed:
1. ✅ Audio "Not Ready" Error FIXED!
Problem: Clicking Play showed "Audio not ready"

Solutions:

✅ Clear status messages: "⏳ Loading audio..."

✅ Shows "⏳ Downloading audio..." during download

✅ Shows "✅ Audio Ready - Click Play!" when done

✅ Play button DISABLED until ready (shows ⏳)

✅ Play button becomes ▶ when ready

✅ Warning if you try to play too early

Result: You'll KNOW exactly when audio is ready!

2. ✅ Thumbnails in List ADDED!
Problem: No thumbnails shown in song list

Solutions:

✅ Fetches thumbnails from YouTube

✅ Shows 80x60px thumbnail for EACH song

✅ Thumbnail on LEFT side of each row

✅ Cached (loads faster second time)

✅ Works for Playlist AND Search

Result: See thumbnails for every song!
